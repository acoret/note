## there is so many choose here, Haskell, Java/Kotlin, Scala, Clojure, Elixir, even Erlang. they has their own trait, Haskell provide a abstract and advance layout for program of functional, Java/Kotlin and Scala share good and simple design for beginner. Elixir and Clojure provide good taste of lisp for some who is bored by Java/C++.
## There is only way to hide a tree that put it at forest. i learn basic skill of using these language, but knowledge gone fast without enough practice, is time to choose one to master now.
## i would like to choose elixir, it provide a good framework [phoenix] for web develop, and Beam provide gen_server, easy IO, good network, lightweight thread and a full-designed fault tolerant system. But to be honest, is hard to convince somebody to install Erlang and Elixir for using your app, except developer, Java has been so popular that Clojure deployed easily.
## So i betrayed from Haskell into Scala and run into Elixir and then pick up the Clojure. i wish i can real stay at Clojure and master it, instead of repeat my experience at changing language.

## project one: use ring to create a game server for simple puzzle of number.
